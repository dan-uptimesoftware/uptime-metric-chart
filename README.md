###Description
The Metric Chart gadget makes it possible to graph metrics collected by up.time in just a few clicks.  You can now finally visualize those important metrics on your custom dashboard in the form of beautiful line or area graphs!  As a bonus, we're also throwing in some additional dashboard layouts, well suited to housing your new graphs.

###Version Compatibility
